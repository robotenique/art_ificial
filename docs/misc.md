# Functions

## Oscillator (function)

To generating a recurring pattern we can use the basic trigonometric functions:
- $sin$
- $cos$
- $tg$

### Type 1

An initial usage can be something like:

```java
float res = abs(sin(k*x)) + h
```

- `k`: Controls the "amplitude"/"velocity" of the wave; The lower this number the "slowest"/"widest" is the wave;
- `h`: Y-axis offset: useful for when you don't things going below zero, or to use this function as a multiplicative factor (i.e. a percentage);
- `abs`: Transforms the `sin` into a "bouncy" function shape. Also useful to automatically remove all negative values (the same can be achieved with `h`);

### Type 2

More complex or irregular scenarios can be generated by just summing up a bunch of `sin` and `cos` functions, with different parameters (possibly randomly generated) for each one of them. This can create lot of variety in stuff like movement or dictate other patterns.

```java
float a = sin(x) + 1;
float b = cos(0.1*x) + 1;
float c = sin(0.5*x) + 1;
float res = a + b + c;
```

# Snippets


## Oscillator (array)

To go from 0 to k then descend from k to 0 we can use this simple loop logic:

```java
int auxV = 1;
int indexCycle = 0;
while(condition) {
indexCycle += auxV;
if (indexCycle == (arrayLength - 1))
    auxV = -1;
if (indexCycle == 0)
    auxV = 1;
}
```

`indexCycle` is the looping variable.
